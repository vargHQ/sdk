 Let's say I've just joined the Roark team as a marketer and I want to add a new article to the website to boost our SEO. The devs won't get to this task anytime soon, but thanks to YoloCode AI, I can take care of it myself. Any changes I make show up instantly on the right so I can see exactly how it looked in production before opening a pull request. So now I'm ready to submit and push this feature and here we go!
